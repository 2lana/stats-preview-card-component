See below:

   <div class="services-block">  
            <div id="amount-companies">10k+ <span class="companies">companies</span></div>
            <div id="amount-templates">314 <span class="templates">templates</span></div>
            <div id="amount-queries">12m+ <span class="queries">queries</span></div>
    </div>
```
```css
  .services-block {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
        color: var(--Slightly-transparent-white);
        align-items: center;
        gap: 7rem;
    }
```
